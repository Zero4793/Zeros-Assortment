Equinox & Solstice does what?
Vampire Blind
	removes enhancements on scored cards, maybe even increases blind to beat when doing so?
some method to save hands for later. specifically those pulled in shop from packs. sometimes a good hand shows up in a pack time and not when wanting to score.
	perhaps a joker/voucher that a saves a hand if the pack is skipped?
lock in boss blind
	must play most played hand
	doesnt soun that bad, but will screw ver sometimes
Vicious Mockery blind
	lose $1 per joker or joker trigger
freeze/lock items in shop, that you cant buy yet
shredder, pay to delete cards from deck
better rerolls, rerolls voucher and packs too
voucher packs?
Jokers with gold sticker have a chance to spawn with red seal

Moons
	bonuses for sub-hand-types that add onto base.
	eg Luna lvls up Full Moon, which is a sub-type of Full House (the pair is mono suit, as is the 3 pair, but diff from each other, not flush house)
	when you play a Full Moon, it adds the Earth/Full-House base mult and chips, then also adds Luna/Full-Moon on top.
	moons are unlocked in shop when you buy their base planet. so your not flooded with many unwanted moons
	they would be smaller scale bonus, like 1-4mult and 5-20 chips probs
	Mars
		Phobos = Flower Four = each of different suit | start weaker, scale better
		Deimos = Flush Four = mono suit | start stronger, scale less
	Jupiter
		Ganymede = club? 
		Callisto =  spade?
		Io =  diamond?
		Europa = heart?
	Saturn
		Titan
		Rhea
		Lapetus
		Dione
		Tethys
	Uranus
	Neptune

more meta upgrades, not just unlock jokers/decks, but also consumables and types, and shop features etc (like freeze instead of being voucher or option)
	basically start with only normal cards and jokers, gotta unlock tarots/spectrals/planets, special features,etc

Joker fusion, some method of combining related jokers into new ones, perhaps if have each of a set unlock the fusion in shop or straight add it to next shop
	shortcut & 4 fingers?
Fusion mod/apli exists already, use it!
we already have an API for this mod. This mod and its fusion systems are complete; fusionjokers
use elbe's fork of the mod
probably want to use tsumani or fusion force as examples of using the api. you don't want to get too bogged down into the base mod's code that you don't actually need to worry about
it's very very simple though i'll just run through the basics of it right now
when you make a joker you do everything the same as a regular joker except the rarity is "Fusion"
keep the "" around the word
and then on any line after the joker is defined in your code, you register it as a fusion with the following line of code
FusionJokers.fusions:add_fusion("material-joker-key-1", <material 1 carry_stat (string)>, <extra_stat (boolean)>, "material-joker-key-2", <material 2 carry_stat (string)>, <extra_stat (boolean)>, "j_modprefix_<key of resulting fusion joker>", <fusioncost (integer)>)
looks a bit complicated at face value
you put the keys of the jokers you wanna fuse in the material joker key sections
the carry_stat is where you put a string which has the name of the value you want to carry to the new joker
e.g if you wanted to carry the scaled mult from spare trousers, you'd write "mult" there
and it will carry the card.ability.mult value from trousers over to the card.ability.mult value of the fusion
if extra_stat is set to true, it will go to card.ability.extra.mult instead
you can carry stats from both jokers, or neither, or just one
the fusion cost is how many $ you spend to fuse the joker
probably a good idea to look at the fusions from the base mod, tsunami, fusion force, and vultbines to make sure you aren't trying to duplicate a fusion
